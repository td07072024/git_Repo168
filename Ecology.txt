The condor soars with its wings held horizontally and its primary feathers bent upwards at the tips.[23] The lack of a large sternum to anchor its correspondingly large flight muscles physiologically identifies it as primarily being a soarer. It flaps its wings on rising from the ground, but after attaining a moderate elevation it flaps its wings very rarely, relying on thermals to stay aloft.[39] In The Voyage of the Beagle, Charles Darwin mentioned watching condors for half an hour without once observing a flap of their wings.[40] It prefers to roost on high places from which it can launch without major wing-flapping effort. Andean condors are often seen soaring near rock cliffs, using the heat thermals to aid them in rising in the air.[41] Flight recorders have shown that "75% of the birds' flapping was associated with take-off", and that it "flaps its wings just 1% of the time during flight".[42] The proportion of time for flapping is more for short flights. Flapping between two thermal glides is more than flapping between two slope glides.[43]

Like other New World vultures, the Andean condor has the unusual habit of urohidrosis: it often empties its cloaca onto its legs and feet. A cooling effect through evaporation has been proposed as a reason for this behavior, but it does not make any sense in the cold Andean habitat of the bird.[10] Because of this habit, their legs are often streaked with a white buildup of uric acid.[28]

There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a 'pecking order' by body language, competitive play behavior, and vocalizations.[44] Generally, mature males tend to be at the top of the pecking order, with post-dispersal immature males tending to be near the bottom.
